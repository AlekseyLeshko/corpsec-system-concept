# corpsec-system-concept

## Idea
I would like to get experience in system design.
I will resolve the fictional problem.

## Business task
We want a system where a client can manage all their company info.
Some company changes must have a document for this change. For example: if a client wants to up company paid-up capital then our system can do this task with all paperwork. The client must get it with minimum documents, questions and headaches.

## Goal
I have a solution architecture for this business task.
The solution's architecture is the core mechanism for this issue expressed as models and services in the code.
I have test cases for validation product requirements.

## Assumptions
- I don't pick a language. Just a plain TS
- I don't choose and design an infrastructure and data centre works. I have ultimate and magical AWS. It can do everything.
